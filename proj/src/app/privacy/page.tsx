              This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, share and protect personal data when you register on our website, use our courses, participate in our assessments and scholarship challenges, or otherwise interact with us. It is published in accordance with the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (&quot;DPDP Act&quot;), the Information Technology Act, 2000 and rules thereunder, and other applicable Indian law. Skill Grimoire is the Data Fiduciary for the personal data described here.
            </p>
            <p>
              By registering on our website or clicking &quot;I Agree&quot;, you (and, if you are under 18, your parent or legal guardian on your behalf) consent to the practices described in this Policy.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4">1. Who this Policy covers</h2>
            <p>
              Students of our partner schools and colleges who register for Skill Grimoire courses; parents/guardians of students below 18; and visitors to our website.
            </p>
          </section>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4">2. Personal data we collect</h2>
            <div className="space-y-4">
              <p><strong>A. Data you provide at registration:</strong> full name; date of birth; class/year of study; institution name and institution code; email address; mobile number; parent/guardian name, contact details and consent confirmation (for students under 18); city/state.</p>
              <p><strong>B. Data generated when you use our services:</strong> course progress and completion records; assessment responses, challenge submissions and scores (including scores generated with the assistance of automated/AI evaluation systems); scholarship and certificate records; support queries and communications with us.</p>
              <p><strong>C. Technical data:</strong> device type, browser, IP address, log data, and cookies (see Clause 9).</p>
              <p><strong>D. Optional location data:</strong> our website can display a live sky/weather theme. If you grant your browser&apos;s location permission, your approximate location is used only in your browser to fetch local sunrise/sunset and weather from a third-party weather service (Open-Meteo). We do not store your location on our servers. Declining this permission does not affect access to courses.</p>
              <p><strong>E. Payment data:</strong> where fees are collected by your institution, we receive only enrolment confirmation from the institution — not your payment details. If you ever pay us directly online, payments are processed by an RBI-authorised payment gateway; we do not store your card, UPI or banking credentials.</p>
              <p>We do not knowingly collect sensitive data such as religion, caste, health information, passwords to third-party services, or biometric data. Please do not upload such information.</p>

              <li><strong>Your institution:</strong> enrolment status, course completion, participation and results in assessments/challenges, and the identity of scholarship and certificate recipients.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4">6. Storage, security and retention</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Data is stored on reputable cloud infrastructure with reasonable security safeguards appropriate to the nature of the data, including encryption in transit and access controls, as required under the DPDP Act and IT Act.

            <p>
              We retain: (a) account and course data while your account is active and for up to 3 years thereafter; (b) certificate and scholarship records for up to 8 years, so that certificates remain verifiable and to meet tax/audit obligations; (c) data required for legal compliance, for the period required by law. Thereafter data is deleted or irreversibly anonymised.
